This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

# Restaurant Website

## Project Overview
This project is a dynamic restaurant website that enables customers to browse and place orders for various meals such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, beverages, and desserts. The website utilizes dynamic routing for a smooth user experience and includes error handling to redirect users to an error page when they visit non-existent routes.

## Features
- Dynamic Routing: Seamless navigation between different sections of the menu.
- Order System: Users can select food items, specify quantities, and place orders.
- Error Handling: Redirects users to an error page if they attempt to access a non-existent page.
- Responsive Design: Optimized for viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: For structuring the web pages.
- CSS: For styling and layout management.
- JavaScript: For dynamic features such as routing and order handling.
